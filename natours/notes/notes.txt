RESPONSIVE DESIGN="DESIGN" PRINCIPLES</for>
    -> Fluid Layouts
        - To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width or height
        - Use %(or vh/vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport(usually layout).
        - Use max-width instead of width
    -> Responsive Units
        - use rem unit instead of pixel for most lengths.
        - to make it easy to scale the entire layout down/up automatically.
    -> Flexible Images
        - by default, images don't scale automatically as we chnage the viewport, so we need to fix that.
        - always use % for images dimensions, together with the max-width property.
    -> Media Queries
        - to change css style on certain viewport widths(breakpoints).
        - useless if fluid layouts not implimented.

==> Layouts types
    -> Float layouts
        - old ways of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property.
        - still in use but getting outdated.
    -> Flexbox
        - modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats.
        - perfect for component layouts.
    -> CSS grid
        - for laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid.
        - perfect for page layouts and complex components.
